# Baseline Submission Literature Review Notes

### [Modeling Online Browsing and Path Analysis Using Clickstream Data](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/alm3/papers/purchase%20conversion.pdf)
- Paper modeling users' ultimate web page destinations based on clickstream and browsing path data
  - Stated goal of the paper is to help predict users' purchase decisions based upon browsing path.  This seems applicable to our goal.

### [Analysis of Usersâ€™ Behavior in Structured e-Commerce Websites](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7933069)
- Similar to the above paper, looks to predict items purchased based on user click log data
  - Again, should be able to adapt some of the methods of this paper for our purpose

### [An annual time use model for domestic vacation travel](https://ac.els-cdn.com/S175553451370023X/1-s2.0-S175553451370023X-main.pdf?_tid=7d98b242-035f-4f53-9d32-23c827de4ff2&acdnat=1541552208_ae6a310375904e48c3a08ac4683b8da7)
- Paper modeling US-based travel decisions and time spent on travel activities
  - Paper specifically calls out economic and demographic factors as impactful on travel preferences, may be useful to mimic some of their features, if possible

### [A Collaborative Location Based Travel Recommendation System through Enhanced Rating Prediction for the Group of Users](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2016/1291358/)
- Paper using a recommender system to recommend travel locations.
  - Could use a similar approach to predict destinations, if features are structured appropriately.
  
### [A Theoretical Analysis of NDCG Ranking Measures] (http://proceedings.mlr.press/v30/Wang13.pdf)
- Exploration of the ranking mechanism that our results will be evaluated by.

### [On Application of Learning to Rank for E-Commerce Search] (./p475-karmaker-santu.pdf)
- Combining popularity based searches with user relevance searches

### [A machine-learning approach to ranking RDF properties] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X15001764#bbr000225)
- Section 3.1 introduces a number of ranking algorithms
